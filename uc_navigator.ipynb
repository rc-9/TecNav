    "For these 5 clinics in the region, you can schedule 5 technicians less per day and still maintain productivity through TecNav. With an average wage of $21/hr for technicians, this would equate to $91980 saved in compensation over an entire year ($7665/month). Note: These savings only account for the wage compensation and not savings on any additional employee benefits. There were 357 amount of moves that occured through TecNav in a single month--this would lead to an estimated $263.94 of gas compensation per month, equating to about $9100 per year. So accounting for this, the urgent care chain would save about $88812.72 for an entire year. This money could be instead invested in further advanced diagnostic tools & imaging equipment that could help the client offer a more comprehensive set of health services or help minimize medical costs for the patients--both of which align with the overall mission of the client's urgent care chain.
