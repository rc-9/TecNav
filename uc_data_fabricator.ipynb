This will enable us to account for real-time directions / drive-time between locations to periodically update \"nearest\" clinic info for better accuracy. However, that is is a cost-based service, and therefore the information was manually compiled for the purporses of this project. The shortest distance will be used in lieu of drive-time as the basis for \"nearest\" distinction.*"

To that extent, corresponding proportion of total yearly patients was decided as 0.25 for the more-populated Denver & Lakewood locations, 0.2 for Wheatridge, and 0.15 for the smaller Edgewater and RINO areas. Based on the size computed from the proportion, a list consisting of location names was constructed to be inputted as the locations that patients visited in the patient records.\n",

    "From the perspective of the client (urgent care clinic chain), their old method of making an employee schedule involves assigning techs based on the anticipated number of patients during peak hours for that clinic and day. The acceptable threshold for the client is to maintain 3:1 ratio of patients:technician as much as possible. Therefore, the past patient records will incorporate this data to further study and optimize during modeling in later stages down the project pipeline."
