This data will be used to also feature engineer the `nearby_clinics` attribute which will be useful for connecting nearby clinical staff members. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: In production, the clinic location & distances data would be retrieved through Google Maps' official API. This will enable us to account for real-time directions / drive-time between locations to periodically update \"nearest\" clinic info for better accuracy. However, that is is a cost-based service, and therefore the information was manually compiled for the purporses of this project. The shortest travel-time will be used in lieu of drive-time as the basis for \"nearest\" distinction. When these metrics are used during the navigation phase of the project, randomized variations will be added to these base-level travel times as a way to mimic real-world variations in drive-time and traffic variations.*"

These features in a client-given dataset would be truncated during the pre-processing stage for this project objective, after any initial explorations.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine (AAUCM), the average urgent care sees about 60-80 patients per day. Therefore, in order to generate a dataset of past patient records for each of the 5 chain clinics, this guideline measure will be used to fabricate records for an entire year's worth of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate real-world data, each location was strategically chosen from different areas that would see different traffic of incoming patients based on city size and location. To that extent, corresponding proportion of total yearly patients was decided as 0.25 for the more-populated Denver & Lakewood locations, 0.2 for Wheatridge, and 0.15 for the smaller Edgewater and RINO areas. Based on the size computed from the proportion, a list consisting of location names was constructed to be inputted as the locations that patients visited in the patient records.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a series of helper functions will be defined for data generation of each corresponding attribute. Additional functions to add \"noise\" to the data will also be strategically setup. Then, data will be constructed for each clinic and compiled together for end output."

Therefore, these sources were references for the common visit reasons and proportions were tuned based on work experience as a technician in an urgent-care setting. For the purposes of the project, it is more important to have different reasons with varying proportions and visit lengths and less important what those actual values are.
