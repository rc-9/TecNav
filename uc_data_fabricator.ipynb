This will enable us to account for real-time directions / drive-time between locations to periodically update \"nearest\" clinic info for better accuracy. However, that is is a cost-based service, and therefore the information was manually compiled for the purporses of this project. The shortest distance will be used in lieu of drive-time as the basis for \"nearest\" distinction.*"

To that extent, corresponding proportion of total yearly patients was decided as 0.25 for the more-populated Denver & Lakewood locations, 0.2 for Wheatridge, and 0.15 for the smaller Edgewater and RINO areas. Based on the size computed from the proportion, a list consisting of location names was constructed to be inputted as the locations that patients visited in the patient records.\n",
